		<Head1>Overpopulation</Head1>
		<p>Overpopulation in the Philippines has slowly risen these past few years. As of now, there are currently 125 million people this 2022 and is expected to increase over the years. Research shows that the reason why overpopulation is still rampant today is because of the lack of basic needs such as food, clothes, and other necessities that many people here in the Philippines sadly don’t have access to. With the lack of important resources, this should have countered overpopulation as they cannot supply their own needs as well as their children, right? Apparently, it is due to the fact that they believe that having children increases their chances of being successful someday. That their children will be able to support them in the future. There are also factors such as lack of sexual education, family planning, and poor use of contraceptives that play a role on the increasing population today.</p> </div>

		<p2>Democracy cannot survive overpopulation. Human dignity cannot survive it. Convenience and decency cannot survive it. As you put more and more people into the world, the value of life not only declines, but it disappears. It doesn’t matter if someone dies.

		<Head1>Why is it important?</Head1>
		<p>It is a must that we must lessen the impact of overpopulation as it can and will have devastating effects especially towards our society and environment today. With the increasing number of populations, demands for resources are slowly on the rise. Resources such as wood, food, water, and many more are being fought over and taken from nature, that the supply that sustains them will not be able to keep up anymore. This results in, more waste being produced, wars over resources, climate change, and even  the extinction of other life.</p> </div>
